This device specific files can be used to build a CWM based recovery for the Samsung GT-S7710 (skomer). Work is in
progress. The CWM port is untested and may not work as expected.


Build instructions:


1. Initialize repo

# repo init -u git://github.com/CyanogenMod/android.git -b cm-10.1


2. Add local manifest

create a xml file unter .repo/local_manifests with the following content:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<manifest>
 <project path="device/samsung/skomer" name="flxo/android_device_samsung_skomer" revision="master" />
 <project path="kernel/samsung/skomer" name="flxo/skomer_kernel" revision="master" />
</manifest>

You can skip the kernel cause cause currently a prebuild kernel is used.

3. sync 

# repo sync

this may take while.

4. build

# source build/envsetup.sh
# lunch cm_skomer-userdebug
# make -jX recoveryimage

5. flash
